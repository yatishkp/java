Telecom Analysis:

Step 1: Data Preprocessing:

1. Remove "State" and "Phone" features from the dataset.
2. Perform Label Encoding on "International Plan" and "Vmail Plan" and on "Churn" features.

Step 2: Feature Selection

3. Identify the feature corelation using corelation matrix.
4. Reomove one of the independent features which are dependent on each other.
	VmailPlan == VMail message
	VMail message == VmailPlan   ========== VmailPlan

	Day Charge == Day Mins
	Day Mins == Day Charge =============== Day Mins

	EveCharge == Eve Mins
	Eve MIns == Eve Charge =============== Eve Mins

	NightMins == NightCharge
	NightCharge == NightMins ============= NightMins

5. So final number of the features after removing one of the independent feature which are dependent on each other
	19-5 = 14
6. Finalised with 14 features. Identify the scope of each features on the target(churn) feature using the Univariate Selection.

Final Features with scores:

Specs        Score
4              Day Mins  3055.100135
6              Eve Mins   445.993054
2    International Plan   276.614354
8            Night Mins   110.011675
3            Vmail Plan    41.021084
0         Account Lengh    23.418636
10   International Mins    14.305956
11  International Calls    13.215160
5             Day Calls     4.826722
1             Area Code     2.717686

Step 3: Model Training

7. Train and Tested the model using Decision Tree with the accuracy of 87%
8. Train and Tested the model using RandomForestClassifier with the accuracy of 93%

Step 4:

9. Take out all the samples which are having Churn as Yes.
10. Caluclate the mean in row wise for all the selected top 10 features.
11. Sort the calculated mean in descending order and add the new feature "Churn-Flag".
13. Put "Churn-Flag" as 1 for the grater mean values (50% of the total count) and remaining as 0 (For Less Mean values)
